React Component structure

Board
  state: array of number of pieces at each location

  4 sections
    6 columns each
      up to 5 pieces in each column, before the additional are numbers in the button piece
  2 waiting areas (one for each color)
  2 end lines (one for each color)
  
24 points (triangles) * 31 (15+15+1) possile values
2 bars, 1 for each color; [1,15]*2 = 16 possible values for a bar = 4 bits. Two bars is 8 bits.

2 homes? Can calculate from 15-(number of pieces on the board). Would be 16 each = 32 possible values.

1 bit (boolean) for whose turn it is.

5 bits per point, 24 points = 120 bits
+4 bits for each bar = 128 bits.
1 bit for turn = 129 bits

dice:
6+5+4+3+2+1 = 21 = 5 bits

129+5 = 134 bits

128 bits = 16 bytes = 4 32-bit integers
8 bits = 1 byte = 1 char for dice roll and whose turn
